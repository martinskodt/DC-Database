<h1>Human / Algorithmic processing</h1>

<h3>Introduction </h3>
<p>This project is about the compression of human thought processes into numerical values used in computation. During Human computer intaeraction we belive there happens a form of compression of complextity. This compression is the process of transferring your internal thoughts processes into an algorithmically interpretable data, in this case consisting of two values. In our project, we aim to demonstrate the gap between complex human comprehension and computational numerical comprehension through this exercise, which you will find below.</p>
<p>Not clear? Think of online reviews of various products, movies or restaurants scaled on a 0-6 star scale. When you see a review consisting only of the number of stars, you do not know the reason why others gave it a particular grade. However, when the review is complemented with the additional comment, you get an insight into the context and intention driving the score given. The similar loss of original and complex meaning takes place in computation. The divergent ways of processing data represented by humans and machines hinder conveying meaning in the exact same way from human thoughts to numerical values and the other way round.</p> <!-- Add here your title 1 -->

<p>We prepared an exercise for you in order to let you grasp this divide first-hand. Below, you will see the coordinate system with a collection of 28 objects of digital culture. Please, follow the instructions written under the canvas to complete the task. We encourage you to analyze the objects through your own experience and score the object through your own understanding of the scales. </p>
<p>You are expected to think about each object in order to decide</p>
<p>1) How much in your opinion the object is digital or analogue. </p>
<p>2) How much in your opinion the object is user-friendly or hostile.</p>
<br>
<p>You are given a broad scale from 0 to 100 for the assessments, as the categories are fluid, keep in mind that there aren’t any wrong answers! </p>

<h1>After the exercise</h1>
<p>You have recived a Final score, which is how close your scores are to everyone elses scores. Please notice how meaningless the final score is in itself without context. By compressing the result down to a single number the meaning of that number deminishes aswell</p>
<h2>Our Definitions for the scales</h2>

<h3>Digital</h3>
<p>The term is used to signify the objects which use a series of numbers (digits) 1 and 0 to record and store data. It is frequently associated with the intangible and invisible qualities of the objects, but it can also refer to the shared Internet space and assisting devices which help us access it and stay connected.</p>

<h3>Analoge</h3>
<p>The term is used to describe a mechanism or device which represents data by measurement of continuous physical variables. It is frequently associated with the tangible and visible qualities of the objects, but can also refer to the objects which enable us to transform the data from the analogue to digital formats.</p>

<h3>Userfriendly</h3>
<p>The term is used to describe the relations between the users and the objects, which evoke subjective feelings of the simplicity of use, intuitiveness and reliability related to the users’ own experiences with the objects or the expected outcome.</p>

<h3>Userhostile</h3>
<p>The term is used to describe the relations between the users and the objects which evoke subjective feelings of frustration, intimidation, antagonism, or offensive nature related to the users’ own experiences with the objects or the expected outcome.</p>

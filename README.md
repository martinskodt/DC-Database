# DC-Database

This is a database of digital objects.
The database itself is in the format of a JSON file. This is because the database is used in a presentational program we have made.
The database can therefore be experiences in 2 ways.

## content/art/03.html
1) This prefered way is to download the repository and run it of your computer (on the edge browser). 
The specific page is called "MIGRANE INDUCING COLLECTION".
Within the repository its the html file called "03".

Because of technical difficulties we could not get the program to work through Github services. The program is made for the.wrong router which has compatebility issues with Github preview functions. (If downloaded, Google Chrome security blocks the script. Run the program in Microsoft Edge instead)

2) You can also see the entire collection [Here](https://github.com/martinskodt/DC-Database/blob/master/content/art/img/03/migraneHTML/DOsheet2.json) , where the database can be seen as raw JSON data. 

Your choise.

# DC-Database

This is a database of digital objects.
The database itself is in the format of a JSON file. This is because the database is used in a presentational program we have made.
The database can therefore be experiences in 2 ways.

1) As a part of the HTML page we have set up. 
### [Human / Algorithmic processing](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/martinskodt/DC-Database/blob/master/content/art/03.html) (There is a chance the canvas dosent work in Google Chrome Browser, i surgest us switch to Microsoft Edge)
2) as raw JSON data.
